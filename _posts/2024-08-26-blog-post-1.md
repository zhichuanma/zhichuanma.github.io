This is my first blog post. I wanna introduce a tool which I am using right now. It is called [`Mescal`](https://mescal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and it's used for [`Energyscope`](https://energyscope.readthedocs.io/en/master/sections/Releases.html). Double counting removal can be done easily by means of it but first of all we should delve into it to deeply understand its mechanism.
