## About
Zhichuan is currently pursuing a master's degree at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), specializing in Energy Environment: Science Technology and Management (STEEM). He is expected to graduate this year. In 2023, he earned his undergraduate degree from [Chu Kochen College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

Meanwhile, Zhichuan is now interning as a research assistant at the Institute of Mechanics, Materials, and Civil Engineering ([iMMC](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/immc)) at the [Université Catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html). Previously, he completed a 6-month internship in Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering ([IPESE](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ipese/)) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and conducted various experimental works at the Institute for Thermal Power Engineering ([ITPE](http://www.itpe.zju.edu.cn/itpe_en/index.asp)) at Zhejiang University. 

Zhichuan's research experiences lie in **energy systems, lifecycle assessment, and multi-criteria optimization**. He is dedicated to achieving sustainable and autonomous clean energy systems with optimal configurations, as well as the decarbonization and digitalization of positive energy districts.

## Research
Zhichuan's current research interests include:
 - **Integration of LCA frameworks into energy system optimization models** *(Generalization and integration of LCA indicators into objective functions, double counting removal for the traditional LCA databases, better constraints for energy system optimization models, etc)*;
 - **Scale-up effect in LCA**;
 - **Optimization theories and applications**.
