## About
Zhichuan is currently pursuing a master's degree at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), specializing in Energy Environment: Science Technology and Management (STEEM). He is expected to graduate this year. In 2023, he earned his undergraduate degree from [Chu Kochen College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

Meanwhile, Zhichuan is now interning as a research assistant at the [Institute of Mechanics, Materials, and Civil Engineering (iMMC)](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/immc) at the [Université Catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html). Previously, he completed a 6-month internship in [Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering (IPESE)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ipese/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and conducted various experimental works at the [Institute for Thermal Power Engineering (ITPE)](http://www.itpe.zju.edu.cn/itpe_en/index.asp) at Zhejiang University. 

Zhichuan's research experiences lie in energy systems, lifecycle assessment, and multi-criteria optimization. He is dedicated to achieving sustainable and autonomous clean energy systems with optimal configurations, as well as the decarbonization and digitalization of positive energy districts.

## Research
Zhichuan's current research interests include:
 - Integration of LCA frameworks into energy system optimization models (Generalization and integration of LCA indicators into objective functions, double counting removal for the traditional LCA databases, better constraints for energy system optimization models, etc);
 - Scale-up effect in LCA;
 - Optimization theories and applications
